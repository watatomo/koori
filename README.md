# Koori

A fork of [Yuki](https://github.com/c-sig/yuki) which is in turn a fork of [Mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro). Outputs just the Japanese text.

Requires Python 3.10.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository by using git or [downloading the zip](https://github.com/watatomo/koori/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place pages in the `images` folder
4. Run `main.py` with `python main.py`
   put images in images directory

The outputs will have the same name as the pages and will be exported to the directory where `main.py` is run.

## To-do

-   [ ] Combine all the outputs into a single file, with headers signifying which sections are from
-   [ ] Have the OCR follow the text in "reading order"
